Why are there 5 hundred ways to build a menu!?


- [Hugo Menu Docs](https://gohugo.io/content-management/menus/)
- [How to create multilevel dropdown menu in hugo?](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/how-to-create-multilevel-dropdown-menu-in-hugo/18373/8)

I've stuck to the "front matter" method for now as that seems to bethe easies but I don't really get a nexted menu this way (2+ levels) if I wanted to list a number of pages below categories.
